## Where is Kinan City?

**Kinan City** (キナンシティ) is one of the cities of the Kalos region in Pokemon XY games and anime.
It is known as **Kiloude City** is the English version and **Batisques** in French.

Kinan City is known for its **Friend Safari** where many trainer come to find pokemon. This is a good place if you want to meet a **lot of new trainers**.

## How does one get a Pokemon Trainer Club account ?

You then first have to fill some personal informations such as your country and birthdate. Then information about the account you want.

You also need to complete a Captcha task to prove that you are a human.

One the subscription is done, the account still needs to be activated in the next 48 hours. An email will be sent to the given address with a link. You need to follow that link to activate the account.

NOTE : You cannot use the same email twice for multiple PTC account, they each need their own email address.

Theses steps must be done for each PTC account you want to create.
